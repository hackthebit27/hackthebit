# C++ Roadmap for Freshers — From Basics to Professional 🚀

If you’re a fresher wondering *“How do I learn C++ the right way and get a job as a professional developer?”* — this guide is for you.  
Let’s break it down step by step.

---

## 1. Start with the Basics 🔰
- Learn syntax: variables, data types, operators, control flow.
- Practice simple programs: calculators, patterns, number problems.
- Get comfortable with **input/output (cin/cout)**.

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int a, b;
    cout << "Enter two numbers: ";
    cin >> a >> b;
    cout << "Sum = " << a + b << endl;
}
```

---

## 2. Master Functions & Pointers
- Understand function declarations and recursion.
- Learn **pointers** (heart of C++).
- Explore references and dynamic memory (`new/delete`).

---

## 3. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 🎯
- Classes, objects, constructors, destructors.
- Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Abstraction.
- Practice designing real-world systems (Bank Account, Library System).

---

## 4. Standard Template Library (STL) 🧰
- Master containers: `vector`, `map`, `set`, `queue`, `stack`.
- Learn algorithms: `sort`, `find`, `count`, `lower_bound`.
- Iterators and lambda expressions.

```cpp
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    sort(v.begin(), v.end(), greater<int>());
    for (int x : v) cout << x << " ";
}
```

---

## 5. Problem Solving & DSA
- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues.
- Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hash Tables.
- Dynamic Programming (DP).
- Practice on **LeetCode, Codeforces, CodeChef**.

---

## 6. Advanced C++ Features ⚡
- Templates and Generic Programming.
- Move semantics and `std::move`.
- Smart pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`).
- Multithreading and Concurrency (`std::thread`, `mutex`).

---

## 7. System-Level & Professional Skills
- Learn **Memory Management** (heap vs stack).
- Understand **Compilers, Linkers, Build systems**.
- Use tools like **CMake, GDB (debugger), Valgrind**.
- Learn coding standards (Google C++ Style Guide).

---

## 8. Build Projects 🚧
- Mini projects (tic-tac-toe, student management system).
- Larger projects:  
  - **Compiler for mini-language**  
  - **Game engine basics**  
  - **Trading system prototype**  

---

## 9. Contribute & Collaborate 🌍
- Push projects to GitHub.
- Contribute to open-source C++ libraries.
- Write blogs (like this one!) to share what you learn.

---

## 10. Prepare for Jobs / FAANG Interviews 💼
- Revise **DSA + C++ fundamentals**.
- Learn **System Design basics**.
- Practice mock interviews on Pramp/InterviewBit.
- Focus on **problem solving + clean C++ code**.

---

### ✅ Quick Checklist
-  Basics (syntax, loops, functions)  
-  Pointers & Memory  
-  OOP  
-  STL mastery  
-  DSA practice  
-  Advanced C++ (templates, smart pointers)  
-  Projects & GitHub  
-  System-level skills  
-  Open-source contributions  
-  Job prep & mock interviews  

---

### 🎯 Final Words
C++ is **tough but rewarding**. Follow this roadmap step by step, and you’ll transform from a fresher into a **professional C++ developer** ready for big companies (even FAANG).  

Happy coding with C++ 🚀💻
